=head1 NAME

B<ads> - commandline access to ADS (Astrophysical Data System)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Make the F<ads> file executable and put it on your execution path.

  ads [options] [author]... [year] [endyear]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<ads> is a commandline tool to pass a query to the website of the
Astrophysical Data System (ADS). The tool constructs a query URL and
sends it to the default web browser. B<ads> takes author names and
publishing years from the command line with as little fuss as
possible. Additional search fields and options can be specified using
command line switches.

=head1 ARGUMENTS and OPTIONS

=over 5

=item AUTHOR NAMES

I<Alphabetic> arguments are parsed as author names. To protect
whitespace in names, use quotes or replace space characters by
underscore C<_> characters. A first name initial can be added like
C<f.last> (separated by dot) or C<last,f> (separated by comma).  If
necessary, an exact author match can be done using B<-i> ORCID.

=item PUBLISHING YEARS

I<Numerical> arguments are interpreted as publishing years. Single or
two-digit years are moved into the 20th/21st century, such that the
year is the current year (+1) or earlier. Two numerical arguments or
an argument like '2012-2014' specify a range. '2004-' means since
2004, '-2004' means until 2004.

=item B<-t> STRING, B<-a> STRING, B<-f> STRING

String phrase to be matched in the I<title>, I<abstract>, or
I<fulltext>, respectively, of a bibliographic source.  Multiple
B<-t>/B<-a>/B<-f> switches with strings can be given to retrieve only
sources that match all requested strings.

=item B<-o> OBJECT

An astronomical object to search for. Quote OBJECT to protect
whitespace, or replace spaces with underscore characters.

=item B<-i> ORCID

Search for an author by ORCID identifier. Leading zeros in the ORCID
can be left out.

=item B<-c>

Sort matched bibliographic sources by citation count.  The default is
to sort by date. B<-c> is a shorthand for B<-sc>, see below.

=item B<-r>

List only refereed sources.

=item B<-A>, B<-P>, B<-G>

Narrow to I<astronomy>, I<physics>, or I<general> database,
respectively.

=item B<-s> SORTING

Sorting mode for matched entries. The mode can be given as a single
letter, in full, or abbreviated.

  d  => date                  # This is the default
  a  => first_author          # abbreviations: fa
  c  => citation_count        # abbreviations: cc
  n  => citation_count_norm   # abbreviations: cn ccn nc ncc
  s  => score

=item B<-d>

Print debugging information. This needs to be the first command line
argument to be effective.
