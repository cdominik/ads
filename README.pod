=head1 NAME

B<ads> - commandline access to ADS (Astrophysical Data System)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Make the F<ads> file executable and put in on your execution path.
Then use the command like this:

ads [options] [author]... [year] [endyear]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<ads> is a commandline tool to pass a query to the website of the
Astrophysical Data System (ADS). The tool constructs a query and
sends it to the default web browser. B<ads> takes author names and
publishing years from the command line with as little fuss as
possible. Additional search fields can be specified using command line
switches, still a lot faster than the web form.

Alphabetic arguments are parsed as author names. Quotes are only
necessary to protect whitespace inside a name. Alternatively, replace
spaces with underscore C<_> characters. A first name can be added like
C<first.last> (separated by dot) or C<last,first> (separated by
comma). Only the initial letter of the first name is significant, so
C<last,f> and C<last,first> are equivalent.

Arguments that are numbers are interpreted as publishing years. Single
or two-digit years are moved into the 20th and 21st century under the
assumption that the specified year is intended to be at most 1 year
into the future. A second year-like argument or something like
'2012-2014' specifies a range. A year ending with `-` means starting
from that year.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 5

=item B<-t> STRING

=item B<-a> STRING

A string to put into the title search field. If there are several
words in a single B<-t> argument, the title will be searched for the
phrase. Use several B<-t> arguments to require the different words
anywhere in the title.

=item B<-a> STRING

A string to put into the abstract search field. See also B<-t> for
information about the effect of several B<-a> switches.

=item B<-f> STRING

A string to put into the fulltext search field. See also B<-t> for
information about the effect of several B<-f> switches.

=item B<-o> OBJECT

An astronomical object to search for. Use multiple B<-o> switches for
multiple objects.  Use C<_> instead of space characters.

=item B<-i> ORCID

Search for an author by ORCID identifier. Several B<-i> switches can
be given.  Leading zeros in an ORCID can be left out.

=item B<-s> SORTING

Sorting mode for matched entries. DEFAULT is 'date', to sort by date.
Values can be given in full, or be abbreviated. The allowed values and
abbreviations are:

   d                  => date                    # This is the default
   a  fa              => first_author
   c  cc              => citation_count
   n  cn ccn nc ncc   => citation_count_norm
   s                  => score

=item B<-r>

Only list refereed sources. Default is to list also unrefereed
sources.

=item B<-d>

Print debugging information. Make this the first command line
argument in order to be most useful.

=head1 EXAMPLES

Get papers by Dullemond and Dominik written in 2004.

    ads Dullemond Dominik,C 2004

Same authors, but only the papers where Dullemond is first author, and
in the range from 2000 to 2004.

    ads -r ^Dullemond Dominik 2000 2004
    ads -r ^Dullemond Dominik 2000-2004
    ads -r ^Dullemond Dominik 0-4

Get papers of Ed van den Heuvel. This example shows that spaces in
name field can be replaced by the underscore character, if you don't
want to quote the name.

    ads "van den heuvel,E"
    ads van_den_heuvel,E

Papers by Antonella Natta, sorted by normalized citations.

    ads -sn a.natta

Unlike most unix commands, this command also allows to give the switch
arguments after or mixed with the author and year arguments, because
additional constraints sometimes present themselves while constructing
the query.

    ads natta,a -t protostar 1990 -sn 2000

Find articles with the phrase "planet formation" in the abstract.

    ads -a "planet formation"

Find articles with both "planet" and "system" anywhere in the
abstract.

    ads -aplanet -a system
