=head1 NAME

B<ads> - commandline access to ADS (Astrophysical Data System)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Make the F<ads> file executable and put it on your execution path.

  ads [options] [author]... [year] [endyear]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<ads> is a commandline tool to pass a query to the website of the
Astrophysical Data System (L<ADS|http://adsabs.harvard.edu/>). The
tool constructs a query URL and sends it to the default web
browser. B<ads> takes author names, publishing years, and astronomical
object identifiers from the command line with as little fuss as
possible. Additional search fields and options can be specified using
command line switches.

=head1 ARGUMENTS and OPTIONS

=over 5

=item AUTHOR NAMES

I<Alphabetic> arguments are parsed as author last names. A first name
initial can be added like 'f.last' or 'last,f'. If an argument looks
like (the significant tail of) an L<ORCID|http://orchid.org>, find
articles claimed by that ORCID.

=item PUBLISHING YEARS

I<Numerical> arguments are interpreted as publishing years. Single or
double digit years are moved into the current or previous century. Two
such arguments or '2012-2014' specify a range. '2004-' and '-2004'
work as expected.

=item [B<-o>] OBJECT

Read the next argument as the name or identifier of an astronomical
object. B<ads> is pretty good at distinguishing objects from authors
even if B<-o> is omitted, but if that does not work or if you want to
be sure, write e.g. 'B<-o> Sirius'.

=item B<-t> STRING, B<-a> STRING, B<-f> STRING

String phrase to be matched in the I<title>, I<abstract>, or
I<fulltext>, respectively, of a bibliographic source.

=item B<-c>

Sort matches by citation count. The default is to sort by date.

=item B<-r>

List only refereed sources.

=item B<-A>, B<-P>, B<-G>

Narrow to I<astronomy>, I<physics>, or I<general> database,
respectively.

=item B<-s> SORTING

Sorting mode for matched entries. The mode can be given as a single
letter, in full, or abbreviated. See also B<-c>, which is short for
B<-s>c.

  d  => date                  # This is the default
  a  => first_author          # abbreviations: fa
  c  => citation_count        # abbreviations: cc
  n  => citation_count_norm   # abbreviations: cn ccn nc ncc
  s  => score

=item B<-d>

Print debugging information. This needs to be the first command line
argument to be effective. Use B<-D> if the URL should be constructed
and shown, but not opened.

=head1 EXAMPLES

Get papers by Dullemond and Dominik written in 2004.

    ads Dullemond Dominik,C 2004

Same authors, but only refereed papers where Dullemond is first
author, and in the range from 1999 to 2004.

    ads -r ^Dullemond Dominik 1999 2004
    ads -r ^Dullemond Dominik 1999-2004
    ads -r ^Dullemond Dominik 99-4

In any of the arguments, underscore can be used instead of space to
avoid the need for quotes.

    ads "van den heuvel,E"
    ads van_den_heuvel,E

Papers by Antonella Natta, sorted by normalized citations.

    ads -sn a.natta

B<ads> allows to freely mix switch arguments with author and year
arguments.

    ads natta,a -sn 1990 2000 -t protostar

Papers by Muro-Arena, Ginski, and Benisty on the object SR 21.

    ads ginski muro-arena benisty sr_21
