=head1 NAME

B<ads> - commandline access to ADS (Astrophysical Data System)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Make the F<ads> file executable and put it on your execution path.

  ads [options] [author]... [year] [endyear]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<ads> is a commandline tool to pass a query to the website of the
Astrophysical Data System (L<ADS|http://adsabs.harvard.edu/>). The
tool constructs a query URL and sends it to the default web
browser. B<ads> takes author names, publishing years, and astronomical
object identifiers from the command line with as little fuss as
possible. Additional search fields and options can be specified using
command line switches.

=head1 ARGUMENTS and OPTIONS

=over 5

=item AUTHOR NAMES

I<Alphabetic> arguments are parsed as author last names. A first name
initial can be added like 'f.last' (separated by dot) or 'last,f'
(separated by comma). Use underscores as in 'van_den_Heuvel' or quote
'"van den Heuvel"' if the name contains spaces.  If an argument looks
like (the significant tail of) an L<ORCID|http://orchid.org>, find
articles claimed by that ORCID.

=item PUBLISHING YEARS

I<Numerical> arguments are interpreted as publishing years. Single or
two-digit years are moved into the current or previous century. Two
numerical arguments or an argument like '2012-2014' specify a
range. '2004-' means since 2004, '-2004' means until 2004.

=item [B<-o>] OBJECT

Read the next argument as the name or identifier of an astronomical
object. Underscore may be used instead of space to eliminate the need
for quotes.  B<ads> is pretty good at recognizing object identifiers
even if you leave out the B<-o>, but if that does not work or if you
want to be sure write, for example, 'B<-o> Sirius'.

=item B<-t> STRING, B<-a> STRING, B<-f> STRING

String phrase to be matched in the I<title>, I<abstract>, or
I<fulltext>, respectively, of a bibliographic source.  Multiple
B<-t>/B<-a>/B<-f> switches with strings can be given to retrieve
sources that match all requested strings.

=item B<-c>

Sort matches by citation count.  The default is to sort by date. B<-c>
is a shorthand for B<-sc>.

=item B<-r>

List only refereed sources.

=item B<-A>, B<-P>, B<-G>

Narrow to I<astronomy>, I<physics>, or I<general> database,
respectively.

=item B<-s> SORTING

Sorting mode for matched entries. The mode can be given as a single
letter, in full, or abbreviated.

  d  => date                  # This is the default
  a  => first_author          # abbreviations: fa
  c  => citation_count        # abbreviations: cc
  n  => citation_count_norm   # abbreviations: cn ccn nc ncc
  s  => score

=item B<-d>

Print debugging information. This needs to be the first command line
argument to be effective.
